Some Edit Remarks

 Codeline 18 -   Consider using a more sophisticated data structure (e.g., an object or database) to handle trivia sessions, especially if you plan to scale the bot or add more features.

 Codeline 37 -   Storing scores in a local dictionary limits persistence. Consider using a database or external storage to retain scores between sessions.

 Codeline 49 -   You could add error handling for potential issues with bot.wait_for, such as invalid message formats, to make the bot more robust.

 Codeline 80 -   Replace the hardcoded bot token with a secure method of loading environment variables to protect sensitive information.
